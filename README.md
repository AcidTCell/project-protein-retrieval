# Protein Fragment Counter for Norovirus Vaccine Development

## Overview

This JavaScript project aids in counting and identifying -mer fragments for protein retrieval, a crucial step in the fabrication and design of a vaccine against Norovirus. The project is developed under the Virology and Vaccine Research and Development Program of the Department of Science and Technology (DOST).

## Introduction

Norovirus, specifically Norwalk Virus Human Genogroups GI, GII, GIV, GVIII, and GIX, is a common cause of viral gastroenteritis in humans worldwide. Developing a vaccine against Norovirus is essential for preventing and controlling outbreaks of this highly contagious virus. One integral step in vaccine development is the identification and characterization of protein fragments (-mers) that can induce an immune response.

## Purpose

The purpose of this project is to provide a tool for researchers and scientists involved in Norovirus vaccine development. By analyzing protein sequences and identifying -mer fragments, researchers can gain insights into potential vaccine candidates and optimize vaccine design strategies.

## Features

- **Sequence Parsing:** Parses protein sequences to identify -mer fragments.
- **Length Filter:** Filters -mer fragments based on user-defined length criteria.
- **Data Visualization:** Provides visual representations of -mer distribution and frequency.
- **Flexible Input:** Accepts protein sequences in various formats (e.g., FASTA, plain text).

## Usage

1. **Input Protein Sequence:** Provide the protein sequence(s) in the input format specified.
2. **Run the Program:** Execute the JavaScript program to parse the sequences and identify -mer fragments.
3. **View Results:** Analyze the output, including -mer distribution and frequency, to guide further research and vaccine development efforts.

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Open the project directory in your preferred code editor.
3. Review the documentation and example files to understand how to use the program.
4. Run the program with sample data to familiarize yourself with its functionality.
